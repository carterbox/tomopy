Install directions
==================

This section covers the basics of how to download and install TomoPy.


Installing from Conda
---------------------

If you only want to run TomoPy, not develop it, then you should install through
a package manager. Conda, our supported package manager, can install TomoPy and
its dependencies for you.

First, you must have `Conda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ installed, then
open a terminal or a command prompt window and run::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge tomopy

This will install TomoPy and all the dependencies from the conda-forge channel.


Updating the installation
-------------------------

TomoPy is an active project, so we suggest you update your installation
frequently. To update the installation run::

    $ conda update -c conda-forge tomopy

For some more information about using Conda, please refer to the `docs
<http://conda.pydata.org/docs>`__.
